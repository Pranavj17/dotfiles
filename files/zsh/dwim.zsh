USAGE
  dwim              correct the last failed command; loads the fix onto your
                    prompt (press Enter to run). Auto-fires on command-not-found.
  dwim status       show the active model, daemon state, and device
  dwim help         show this help

HOW IT WORKS
  A typo'd command (command not found) auto-suggests a fix via a warm local
  MLX model — no typing needed. For commands that ran but failed (bad flags,
  exit != 0), run 'dwim' yourself to get a correction.
